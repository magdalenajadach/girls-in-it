# Story behind this APP

My first [API app](https://github.com/magdalenajadach/girlsin.it), built ages ago with Angular, was a news aggregator focused on highlighting stories about women in the tech and news space. Though it hasn’t been updated in quite some time, I’ve always loved the purpose behind it.

Now, I’m giving it a fresh start by rewriting it with React and Next.js. This time, I’m using the [Webz.io News API](https://webz.io/products/news-api#lite) - to pull in the latest stories about women’s achievements in sports. It’s my way of ensuring we all stay informed and inspired by the incredible contributions of women in sports!

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```
yarn dev

```

Open [http://localhost:3667](http://localhost:3667) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
