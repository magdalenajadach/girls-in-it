# Story behind this App

The original version of this app, [GirlsIn.IT](https://github.com/magdalenajadach/girlsin.it), was created years ago using Angular, serving as a news aggregator focused on women in tech and current events. Although it hasn’t been updated in a while, I’ve always been passionate about its mission: spotlighting women’s achievements.

Now, I’m giving it a fresh, modern spin by rewriting it with React and Next.js. This time around, I’m focusing on women in sports, using the Webz.io News API to gather the latest news on women's accomplishments across sports. The goal? To ensure we’re all better informed and inspired by the powerful stories of women athletes, who deserve more media coverage and recognition than they often receive.

## Tech details

This project was bootstrapped with Next.js, using `create-next-app`.
